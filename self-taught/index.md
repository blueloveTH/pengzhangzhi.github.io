﻿﻿Here I list a bunch of great CS self-learning materials that benifit me a lot. 

This doc is for self-taught students who is like me, interested in CS while have no access to good education. I maintain a [github repo]([pengzhangzhi/self-taught-CS (github.com)](https://github.com/pengzhangzhi/self-taught-CS)) to track the code and notes I took when learning a course.

The eudcation backgourd only tells about the history. The course you took, the note your written, and the code you implemented make the future you who you are.

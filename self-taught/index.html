<body><p>﻿﻿Here I list a bunch of great CS self-learning materials that benifit me a lot. </p>
<p>This doc is for self-taught students who are like me, interested in CS while have no access to good education. For that, I am deeply grateful for those selfishless professors who share these excellent learning meterials for free. In return to their kindness, I personally maintain several curated lists that collect state-of-the-art  papers and courses in my research fields, see my <a href='https://github.com/pengzhangzhi'>github homepage</a>. 
I maintain a <a href='https://github.com/pengzhangzhi/self-taught-CS'>github repo</a> to track the code and notes I learned in a course.</p>
<p>The eudcation backgourd only tells about the history. The course you took, the note your written, and the code you implemented make the future you who you are.</p>

    <h4>
    The whole point of doing so is for the democracy of knowledge.
